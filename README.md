# Javolver
**Javolver** is a simple yet powerful **genetic algorithm** system in Java.

The library is designed to be extremely simple to set up and run.  The user simply needs to create a derived class from the Individual class, and implement three functions:
    clone()
    toString();
    calculateScore();
    
An object of Javolver is then created and passed in the user's derived type, and then the evolving can be started.
